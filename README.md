# Data-Streaming-Kafka-MongoDB-PostgreSQL-Streamlit
ðŸ“Š Data Streaming Pipeline: Kafka + MongoDB + PostgreSQL + Streamlit
A complete data streaming pipeline using time-series COVID-19 data. The project ingests data through Apache Kafka, stores it in both MongoDB (NoSQL) and PostgreSQL (SQL), and visualizes insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Includes automated EDA with YData Pandas Profiling.


## Project Overview 
- Sending data from a Kafka Producer. 
- Receiving the data through a Kafka Consumer. 
- Using Apache Kafka as the messaging backbone for the data streaming. 
- Running all components in isoaled Docker containers. 


## Dataset
The data used for this project is downloaded from Kaggle entitled "Real-time Covid 19 Data" (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/covid-19). The exact filename of the dataset used is: worldwide-aggregate.csv
